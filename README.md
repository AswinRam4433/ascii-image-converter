> *"FACT: Your images have always wanted to be converted into ASCII art. Why? Because they deserve to be as majestic as Dwight Schrute’s face in plain text."*  

Welcome to **ASCII-fy**, the one-stop solution to take your overachieving images and strip them down to the glorious simplicity of characters. Ever wanted to see Dwight Schrute’s beet-farming glory rendered in `@`, `#`, and `.`? Well, here’s your chance.  

## **What Does It Do?**  
This Python script takes any image and processes it through a sophisticated (read: moderately clever) algorithm to produce ASCII art in varying sizes. Now you can marvel at the beauty of your favorite office manager, pet, or poorly lit selfie—all in the aesthetic of 1980s computer terminals.

## **Why ASCII Art?**  
- It’s retro.  
- It’s cool.  
- It's Dwight-approved
- It's Jim-proof 
- Because plain text is easier to send in emails.  

## **How Does It Work?**  
1. Input an image (start with Dwight Schrute, we insist).  
2. Specify your desired size 
3. Let the Python magic happen.  
4. Marvel at the resulting ASCII masterpiece:  

## **How to Run It?**  
1. Clone this repo.  
2. Install dependencies.  
3. Run the script and behold...

## **Known Issues**  
- If you squint too much, it might look like… anything.
